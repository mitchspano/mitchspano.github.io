### üëã Hey there!

I'm **Mitch Spano**, the mind and keystrokes behind [www.mitchspano.com](http://www.mitchspano.com). By day, I navigate the vast universe of Salesforce, architecting solutions that empower businesses and discovering best practices and techniques previously unknown. By night (and sometimes, well into the wee hours), I chronicle my adventures and revelations in the realm of Salesforce development on this very blog.

### üöÄ My Journey

Over a decade ago, armed with nothing but curiosity and a laptop, I embarked on a quest to master the technology behind this platform called Salesforce. Fast forward to today, I've not only unraveled many of its secrets but also have had the privilege of shaping the Salesforce journeys for organizations worldwide - leading some of the best engineering teams at some of the most world renowned technology companies. Through this blog, I share this collection of knowledge, offering tutorials, tips, and tricks that illuminate the path for fellow developers.

### üí° Why?

Because learning to become a great engineer in the Salesforce ecosystem is a challenge. There are plenty of basic tutorials out there, but there are very few resources for people trying to become masters of the Salesforce engineering craft. This blog is my way of contributing to the community, ensuring that whether you're a seasoned architect or a curious newcomer, you have a compass in this interesting digital landscape.
